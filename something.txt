I never thought, did I! u003cbru003eu003cbru003e*********SOME SPOILERS**********u003cbru003eu003cbru003eEdmond Dantes was a wonderful man of 19-years-old. He had a woman he loved and was going to marry named Mercedes. A loving father. And he was going to be captain of the wonderful ship, Pharaon. u003cbru003eu003cbru003eThe the jealous bastards or just bastards in general ruined life for Dantes. u003cbru003eu003cbru003eu003cbu003e1. Danglarsu003cbru003e2. Fernandu003cbru003e3. Villefortu003c/bu003eu003cbru003eu003cbru003eI hate these men with such a passion I just wanted someone to kill their evil selves. u003cbru003eu003cbru003eu003cimg src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1469397443ra/19813754.gif" alt=" " class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"u003eu003cbru003eu003cbru003eAll of the jerks had a hand in putting Dantes in prison for 14 effing years! Yeah! For what? For NOTHING! u003cbru003eu003cbru003eDantes was in such despair he was going to starve himself to death. I can\'t even! u003cbru003eu003cbru003eThen one night Dantes hears a scratching sound and soon realizes someone is tunneling. Dantes decides to tunnel as well. At some point the two of them tunnel to each other. Dantes gets to meet Abbe Faria, the mad man (so they say) in the cell next door. Abbe Faria thinks he\'s tunneling out to freedom but he made a miscalculation. But Dantes and Abbe devise a new plan and this takes some years to do all of this tunneling. But the Abbe is old and sick and having seizures. He\'s not going to be able to make it so Dantes waits with him. He is like another father figure to Dantes. And who in the hell but Dantes would wait and not leave his friend. Because Dantes is good and kind and loving. u003cbru003eu003cbru003eAbbe Faria is also the one that opens Dantes eyes to who the culprits were that put him in jail. Poor Dantes couldn\'t see this at the time and he couldn\'t read what we were reading so he had no clue. Abbe Faria also tells Dantes about tons of gold and jewels that he has hidden on the island of Monte Cristo. He makes Dantes remember everything about getting there and where to find the treasure. u003cbru003eu003cbru003eUnfortunately, Abbe Faria dies and it was so sad. Dantes was so grief stricken over his friend. Dantes decided to leave then as he had nothing else to stay for and he put himself in Abbe Faria\'s place all wrapped up waiting to be buried. Well, he doesn\'t actually get buried but thrown out to sea and luckily Dantes managed to save himself. u003cbru003eu003cbru003eWe go on to read of the tale of how Dantes gets to Monte Cristo and soon he is beyond rich and he is so smart and ready to get IT DONE! u003cbru003eu003cbru003eAnd Dantes doesn\'t just run off and kill people. He\'s smart. He tears down their houses, their world without them knowing who he is until the bitter end. And all of the riches they acquired while he rotted in jail was disgusting. Anyway, some people did die but that\'s of little importance. u003cbru003eu003cbru003eu003cimg src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1469397443ra/19813755.gif" alt=" " class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"u003eu003cbru003eu003cbru003eDantes is also kind to all of the people that were kind to him or tried to help him while he was in jail. He\'s such a wonderful person. Yes, I know I keep saying that. He helps Morrel and his family when they were about to lose everything. They even lost the Pharaon but Dantes brings him a new one without Morrel even knowing where the ship came from. Dantes gave them money. He helped the family even after Morrel was gone. I cried and cried at his generosity. u003cbru003eu003cbru003eAnd to sit and read of all the plans and all of the people crumble. u003cbru003eu003cbru003eThe only person to recognize Dantes, even with his disguises, was Mercedes. But she went and married freaking Fernand and had a kid. Dantes was friends with Mercedes son but things could never be good for them again. And it\'s so, so sad for so many involved. u003cbru003eu003cbru003eOh, and Dantes called himself "Sinbad the Sailor" and "The Count of Monte Cristo." Of course I guess if you own a rock and gold and jewels and many other things, you can call yourself anything you want! :-) u003cbru003eu003cbru003eI can\'t sit here and go on and on about the book. It\'s freaking 1276 pages! I\'m not that good of a reviewer to tell you something good about that many pages. Just know. . . THIS BOOK is freaking AWESOME! If you have been debating on reading it and afraid of it\'s size, who cares, just read it. I mean you can take two months or however long to enjoy Dantes and his adventures, but don\'t let the "tome" bother you. It\'s not boring at all! NOT ONE BIT! u003cbru003eu003cbru003eI give it all the stars! u003cbru003eu003cbru003eu003cimg src="https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1469397443ra/19813756.gif" alt=" " class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"u003eu003cbru003eu003cbru003eSail on dear, Dantes! u2665u003cbru003eu003cbru003eu003cimg src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1469397443i/19813757.jpg" alt=" : " class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"u003eu003cbru003eu003cbru003eMY BLOG: u003ca href="http://melissa413readsalot.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-count-of-monte-cristo-by-alexandre.html" rel="nofollow noopener"u003eMelissa Martin\'s Reading Listu003c/au003e","rating":5,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/17438949?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"favorites","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/17438949?shelf=favorites"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"5-stars","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/17438949?shelf=5-stars"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"audio","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/17438949?shelf=audio"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"beautiful-cover","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/17438949?shelf=beautiful-cover"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"march-of-the-mammoths-2023","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/17438949?shelf=march-of-the-mammoths-2023"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"paperback-own","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/17438949?shelf=paperback-own"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"reread","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/17438949?shelf=reread"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1438326810"},"likeCount":848,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":0},"User:4622890":{"id":4622890,"__typename":"User","legacyId":4622890,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1528390751i/4622890._UY200_CR2,0,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":1993,"viewerRelationshipStatus":null,"name":"Emily May","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may","contributor":null,"followersCount":297870},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.WQe1IApbA75c_BASJ6CjpA":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.WQe1IApbA75c_BASJ6CjpA","__typename":"Review","creator":{"__ref":"User:4622890"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1646653887213,"createdAt":1345047462000,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1548574476000,"text":"Picture this: you are nineteen years old with your whole life ahead of you. You\'ve just been offered the job of your dreams. And you\'re about to marry the person you\'ve loved since childhood. When, suddenly, a couple of jealous men decide to frame you as a Bonapartist (a crime which was punished by death or life imprisonment) and have you sent away to rot in an island prison. I think it\'s fair to say you\'d be feeling a touch bitter about the whole ordeal.u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eThis is what happens to the young Edmond Dantes when he is betrayed at first by men jealous of his career and fiancee, then again by a man who sees a opportunity to benefit himself by sending Dantes to his jail cell. After spending fourteen years in a gloomy dungeon, Dantes finally has a chance to escape and seek revenge on those who wronged him, whilst also rewarding those who stuck by him and fought to prove his innocence.u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eI always try to read both positive and negative reviews of books so I can understand why people had a different opinion from my own, and the verdict on this from negative reviews seems to fall into one of two categories: 1) the book is too long, or 2) they were unable to side with Dantes when he sets out with his vengeful aims. u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003ePersonally, I agree that u003ca href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/7126.The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo" title="The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas" rel="noopener"u003eThe Count of Monte Cristou003c/au003e is several novels in one and I\'m not surprised that it was originally published in installments. That being said, though, the story itself is fascinating. It brings in historical elements and combines them with a great set of fictional characters to make a very rich story. There are parts that are sad and parts that are heartwarming and it all adds up to a great balance of the two.u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eAs for the second problem, it is my own personal taste that I love a good revenge story. I know forgiveness is supposed to be a virtue blah blah and perhaps it doesn\'t make me a great person that I couldn\'t shake the hand of the one who\'d ruined my life. Perhaps. But I believe Dantes suffered more than anyone in this tale, even after he had got his revenge. And I always did cheer for the likes of Beatrix Kiddo. So when the "avenging angel" struck, I was right there with him.u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eI think it says something when a 1200+ page novel doesn\'t bore me for a second, and u003ca href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/7126.The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo" title="The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas" rel="noopener"u003eThe Count of Monte Cristou003c/au003e never once dragged as it took me through a plot spanning many years. There are several stories being told throughout and I found all of them interesting: Dantes\' betrayal, u003ca href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/155403.The_Shawshank_Redemption" title="The Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King" rel="noopener"u003eThe Shawshank Redemptionu003c/au003e-style time in prison where Dantes makes a close friend, the historical story of Napoleon\'s return, and Dantes\' search for revenge. It\'s hard not to be enthralled by this complex world and its characters. My one complaint is the direction Dantes\' romantic life took in the end, but whatever, there are over a thousand pages of awesomeness here and if you have the time to spare for this book/doorstopper/possible murder weapon, you should definitely read it.u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eu003ca href="http://emilymay.me" rel="nofollow noopener"u003eBlogu003c/au003e | u003ca href="https://www.facebook.com/thebookgeekreviews" rel="nofollow noopener"u003eFacebooku003c/au003e | u003ca href="https://twitter.com/thebookgeek01" rel="nofollow noopener"u003eTwitteru003c/au003e | u003ca href="http://instagram.com/emleemay" rel="nofollow noopener"u003eInstagramu003c/au003e | u003ca href="https://www.youtube.com/c/EmilyMayTheBookGeek" rel="nofollow noopener"u003eYoutubeu003c/au003e","rating":5,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4622890?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"classics","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4622890?shelf=classics"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"2012","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4622890?shelf=2012"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"historical","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4622890?shelf=historical"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"clothbound-own","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4622890?shelf=clothbound-own"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/392375096"},"likeCount":794,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":0},"User:2863914":{"id":2863914,"__typename":"User","legacyId":2863914,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1612195247i/2863914._UY200_CR17,0,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":556,"viewerRelationshipStatus":null,"name":"Joel","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2863914-joel","contributor":null,"followersCount":1667},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.I6ovV4Er6C1XQ-BKM7AYMg":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.I6ovV4Er6C1XQ-BKM7AYMg","__typename":"Review","creator":{"__ref":"User:2863914"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1527756583559,"createdAt":1256155548000,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1308799270000,"text":"Revenge is a dish best served cold.

Most editions in English ARE abridged, but usually don\'t say they are. Not sure if this Penguin edition is, it\'s not the one i read. u003cbr /u003eReaders generally think of this as a tale of revenge. For me, it was much deeper. I\'m not a religious person at all, but for me this is a book that makes you question the existence of God or a god. Edmond Dantes is without flaw, a truly good person, and his life is ruined because a) others envy him and b) he was the victim of an unfortunate coincidence. u003cbr /u003eEven when he escapes prison and finds a monumental treasure, it is years before he finds peace (I dont think he ever finds happiness). u003cbr /u003eThe questions it raises are: why are good people so often punished by horrible tragedies when truly bad people are so often able to float through life with all the rewards that this world can bestow? u003cbr /u003eThe other question: Dantes spends much of his life after prison seeking the people who tossed into the oubliette u2014 not to get revenge but to punish them. He believes he is the angel of god and that he has been freed from prison so he can do god\'s will by punishing these evil men. u003cbr /u003eBut as he proceeds in his quest, he begins to question whether any man can actually be the angel of god, whether it\'s a sign of mania or even insanity to think you can possibly know what is god\'s will. u003cbr /u003eIn the end, evil is punished, and it is because of wheels that Dantes sets in motion. But I don\'t think he is ever able to know if he is just another man seeking to ruin other men, or if he is in fact the angel of god. It\'s a question that, as a journalist, I try to always remember: we are none of us the angel of god. All we can do is try to live the best life we can and not decide who deserves to be punished or even ruined.","rating":5,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/324433?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"dumas-et-al","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/324433?shelf=dumas-et-al"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5393245"},"likeCount":519,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":0},"User:44531801":{"id":44531801,"__typename":"User","legacyId":44531801,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1533839073i/44531801._UX200_CR0,7,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":1259,"viewerRelationshipStatus":null,"name":"Nayra.Hassan","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44531801-nayra-hassan","contributor":null,"followersCount":5634},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.PmDO53Q9z6wUJcCKnU3AEQ":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.PmDO53Q9z6wUJcCKnU3AEQ","__typename":"Review","creator":{"__ref":"User:44531801"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1694689796983,"createdAt":1457976554000,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1672522059254,"text":"u003cbu003eu0645u0646u0630

1200 pages of suffering and revenge! u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eI enjoyed it. I did not like it quite as much as some of the other big classics I have read, but it was very good. The two things that brought it down a bit for me were:u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003e- It felt a bit more drawn out than it needed to be. At a couple of points I was ready for Dumas to get to the point.u003cbr /u003e- Some of the plot was very convoluted. While this did lend itself well to the Count\'s intricate plotting, I would occasionally get to a chapter and say, "Wait, what!?" A few times I tried to reorient myself with chapter summaries online, but stopped after it became difficult to avoid spoilers. u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eWith all the negative out of the way, I will say that is was definitely a great book. At times it was riveting. At others it was clever. At pretty much all times it was dark and seemingly hopeless. The unabridged is great because it has everything as Dumas wanted it, but it does require quite a bit of commitment.u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eFinal judgement: A must for those who want to read all the classics, but probably a bit much for the causal reader.

The first part of the book filled me with dread as I waited for disaster to strike; the second part made me truly feel Edmond Dantes\' despair, as he was thrown into a dungeon in the historical Chateau d\'If by greedy, power-seeking, selfish and lustful men, to spend the rest of his life in squalor. u003cbru003eu003cbru003eu003cimg src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1403938948i/10168075._SX540_.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="description" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"u003e u003cbru003eu003cbru003eAfter 14 years, Edmond (soon to become the Count) escapes from his island prison and things really start to get interesting as he plans and executes his revenge on the four men who conspired to ruin his life. Dumas\' writing, even after 170 years and in translation, is powerful and moving, and the Count\'s complex and intricately planned revenge was awe-inspiring. Our buddy read group had a great time analyzing what was happening in the story, and discussing various Biblical and other literary allusions. (Our discussion can be followed in the comments attached to our reviews, but be warned that those threads are Spoiler City.)u003cbru003eu003cbru003eBut as we started getting closer to the end of the Count\'s revenge and this story, things started to go a little off the rails for all of us. The Count clearly views himself as an avenging angel, almost as a god himself, on a divine mission to punish the wicked. This view (which the author seems to share) becomes more and more uncomfortable as the death and destruction spread. u003cbru003eu003cbru003eMore about my problems with this book, and the reasons it gets 4 stars rather than 5, which are extremely spoilerish:u003cbru003eu003cbru003eu003cinput type="checkbox" class="spoiler__control" aria-label="The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide." onchange="this.labels[0].setAttribute(\'aria-hidden\', !this.checked);" id="99faf094-df0c-4f55-99d4-748a8ddfc789" /u003eu003clabel aria-hidden="true" class="spoiler" for="99faf094-df0c-4f55-99d4-748a8ddfc789"u003e The Count\'s revenge extends itself to innocent members of the original plotters\' families, which he justifies by (wrong-headedly) quoting the Old Testament scripture about the punishment of God extending itself to the third and fourth generations of their children. He finds peoples\' weaknesses and exploits them, suggesting an untraceable poison to a mother who he knows is anxious to see her young son inherit great wealth. Only when that young son is also dead, does the Count begin to question whether he has gone too far: u003cblockquoteu003eMonte Cristo became pale at this horrible sight; he felt that he had passed beyond the bounds of vengeance, and that he could no longer say, "God is for and with me."u003c/blockquoteu003eBut then, amazingly and disappointingly, he decides he cannot have been mistaken all of these years and that it is simply his lack of clear sight creating this doubt. He does show some mercy to the last conspirator, but this final act of mercy seems to be prompted by the Count\'s pride rather than by a realization that he was wrong in any way. u003cbru003eu003cbru003eAnother issue was that the Count\'s former fiancu00e9e, Mercedes, whose only sin was to get married to someone else after the Count was taken to prison, is left to spend the rest of her life sorrowing and alone, while the Count (who\'s in his 40s now) has a beautiful, young Greek slave fall in love with him and essentially give him a new start in life and love. After everything he did wrong, it really irked me that the Count gets to sail off into the sunset with this gorgeous young girl while Mercedes has to spend the rest of her life meditating in solitude. (This is pretty much always changed in the movies, one example of where Hollywood got it right.)u003cbru003eu003cbru003eThe Count also decides to save the life of one of the conspirators\' daughters, the youngu2014and completely innocentu2014Valentine, but only because Maximillien, the son of a man who was loyal to the Count, is in love with Valentine. But then he decides, for no good reason, to allow Max to believe u003ciu003efor an entire monthu003c/iu003e that Valentine was dead. His gall in this subplot was unjustified and beyond unmitigated, and neither of these sweet people calls him on it or gets the least bit angry about being so manipulated.u003c/labelu003eu003cbru003eu003cbru003eFinal gripe: why does everyone in this book who\'s in love have to have the attitude that death is better than being separated from their love, or their love is not true? I\'ve come across it in several Victorian-era books (it still lives on in some books like u003ca href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/41865.Twilight__Twilight___1_" title="Twilight (Twilight, #1) by Stephenie Meyer" rel="noopener"u003eTwilightu003c/au003e), and it seriously annoys me every time. Yes, it sucks if you can\'t marry the person you love, or if the person you love dies. u003cuu003eBut this does not mean that your life is over and you should commit suicideu003c/uu003eu2014or even swear off loving anyone else and mope around for the remainder of your days. Life goes on. If you allow yourself to move on, you will find that you\'re more resilient than you think. /rantu003cbru003eu003cbru003eI really don\'t object to reading about a flawed hero, but it does bother me that the author u003cinput type="checkbox" class="spoiler__control" aria-label="The following text has been marked spoiler.

That\'s because they make television drama series and soap operas instead. To my mind, this novel is the 19th Century equivalent of a long-running and compelling television series. I can readily imagine being a reader of the u003ciu003eJournal des Du00e9batsu003c/iu003e between August 1844 and January 1846, impatiently waiting for the next installment of u003ciu003eLe Comte de Monte Cristou003c/iu003e to be published, eagerly discussing each installment with my friends around the 19th Century equivalent of the water-cooler, exclaiming at each plot development, gasping at every cliff-hanger. u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eWhat fun it has been over the past few weeks to consume u003ciu003eThe Count of Monte Cristou003c/iu003e in much the same way as I watched all seven seasons of u003ciu003eThe West Wingu003c/iu003e one after another a few years ago: wanting to spend as much time as I could with the story, yet simultaneously wanting to slow down in order to prolong the enjoyment, loving (almost) every moment of it. u003ciu003eThe Count of Monte Cristou003c/iu003e is probably more u003ciu003eDallasu003c/iu003e than it is u003ciu003eThe West Wingu003c/iu003e, but you get the general idea. u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eThe plotu2019s the thing here. Dumas (and his collaborator August Maquet) created a dense and complex story, the many threads of which are woven together into a most satisfying whole, with no threads left loose at the end of more than 1200 pages. This is the story Edmond Dantu00e8su2019 revenge against the three men who caused him to be unjustly accused of treason and imprisoned for fourteen years. Dantu00e8s, who becomes the Count of Monte Cristo, carries out his revenge after developing a careful plan over many years. For him, revenge is most definitely a dish to be eaten cold. Itu2019s also a dish which causes a degree of moral indigestion, as he comes to realise that what he sees as a divine obligation can have unintended (and horrific) consequences.u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eItu2019s far from a plausible story and itu2019s fair to say that the theme of revenge is more successfully realised than is the theme of redemption. The plot is indeed totally over the top, with elements of fable and fairy tale, replete with Orientalist imagery which for me brought to mind u003ciu003eThe Arabian Nightsu003c/iu003e. Luckily for such an intricately plotted novel, the story moves along at a cracking pace, much of it in dialogue, which makes for an easy read notwithstanding the novelu2019s length. u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eCharacterisation is somewhat sacrificed in the process of weaving the many strands of the plot together. While the Count himself is a compelling character, other characters are less so and female characters in particular are rather flat. One exception is Eugu00e9nie Danglars, who has the potential to be very interesting in her own right, although not enough time is spent with her for her potential to be fully realised. However, deficiencies in characterisation are more than made up for by the sheer thrill of the tale. u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eMy enjoyment of u003ciu003eThe Count of Monte Cristou003c/iu003e has been increased by it being a buddy read with several members of the Comfort Reads group. It has also been increased by listening to it as a French language audiobook downloaded from u003ca target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="http://www.audiocite.net"u003ewww.audiocite.netu003c/au003e. Apart from hearing Dumasu2019 words as they were written, there was the immense joy of hearing beautiful, literary French, including the wonderful simple past tense, never heard in regular speech. u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eI canu2019t say that this is a flawless novel and deserves five stars for that reason. But I was on the edge of my seat as I listened to it for some 47 hours. As I neared the end, I started wondering just how soon I could justify a re-read.

Early on, I started rooting for Dantu00e8s and I was totally on board for him to get his fucking revenge. u003cblockquoteu003en  u003cbu003eBut Dantu00e8s cannot stay in prison for ever; one day he will come out, and on that day, woe and betide the one who put him there!u003c/bu003enu003c/blockquoteu003eWritten around 1844, u003ciu003eThe Count of Monte Cristou003c/iu003e is one of Alexandre Dumas\'s most famous and beloved novels and was a huge bestseller back in its day. u003ciu003eThe Countu003c/iu003e was originally serialized, which attributed to the fact as to why there are so many plot twists, turns and cliffhangers in this story. Dumas had to hold his readers\' interest, so that the newspaper would keep on publishing his book. So, if u003ciu003eThe Countu003c/iu003e starts to feel like a soap opera as you are reading it, you know why.u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eOn the day of his wedding to Mercu00e9du00e8s, Edmond Dantu00e8s, first mate of the u003ciu003ePharaonu003c/iu003e, is falsely accused of treason, arrested, and imprisoned without trial in the Chu00e2teau d\'If, a grim island fortress off Marseilles. A fellow prisoner, Abbu00e9 Faria, correctly deduces that his jealous rival Fernand Mondego, envious crewmate Danglars, and double-dealing Magistrate De Villefort framed him. Faria inspires his escape and guides him to a fortune in treasure. As the powerful and mysterious Count of Monte Cristo, he arrives from the Orient to enter the fashionable Parisian world of the 1830s and avenge himself on the men who conspired to destroy him.u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eI was not only positively surprised by the ridiculousness of the plot, but also by the accessibility of the writing. Robin Buss did an amazing job at translating this literary masterpiece and he can honestly have all of my money. I underlined so many passages, because they were either beautiful as fuck or downright savage. Overall, Dumas\' writing style gave me serious Oscar Wilde vibes. (I know, that Oscar wasn\'t even born yet at the time u003ciu003eThe Countu003c/iu003e was written but pshhh, let me have my Oscar moment, please!)u003cblockquoteu003en  u003cbu003eu201cYes, devotion. That is the honest way to describe ambition when it has expectations.u201du003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eu201cAnd whatever philosophers say, itu2019s marvellous to be rich.u201d u2013 u201cAnd, above all, to have ideas.u201du003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eu201cI know that the world is a drawing-room from which one must retire politely and honourably, that is to say, after paying oneu2019s gaming debts.u201du003c/bu003enu003c/blockquoteu003eThese are just a few examples of the wittiness that all our characters displayed. The dialogue was sharp and engaging, and kept me interested in all of the characters, whether villain or hero (because Dumas keeps it quite black and white, if we\'re going to be real here), I was invested into all of the characters\' fates. u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eAnother reason why I was immediately sucked into u003ciu003eThe Countu003c/iu003e was Dumas\' ability to make his setting and scenery come to life. I was amazed by how authentically Dumas interwove the historical and political context, as well as the atmosphere of his chosen locations into the narrative. Strap on your traveling shoes, because the Count\'s going to take you all over the world. The story takes place in France, Italy, and islands in the Mediterranean during the historical events of 1815u20131839: the era of the Bourbon Restoration through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France. It begins just before the Hundred Days period (when Napoleon returned to power after his exile). u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eAnd even though I knew only very few about France\'s political landscape of the time, Dumas makes it incredibly easy to navigate through and engage with his narrative. I am by no means a history geek, but I was so fucking invested in the historical setting of the book, as it was such a fundamental element of it. Dantu00e8s\' adventure is based primarily on the values of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness. It is important to understand why Dantu00e8s was imprisoned, what was the nature of his alleged treason? Why was Villefort so afraid of his father being a Bonapartist? u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eSeparating the historical and political scene from u003ciu003eThe Count of Monte Cristou003c/iu003e is like trying to separate salt from the ocean. In order to really understand what u003ciu003eThe Countu003c/iu003e\'s all about, we need to take a look at what was going on in France at the time. We know that Edmond Dantu00e8s\'s story spans from around the 1815 until around 1838. We know from Danglars\'s report at the very beginning of the novel that Edmond has stopped at the island of Elba to retrieve a letter on his way back to Marseilles which is addressed to Noirtier. Guess who was exiled to the island of Elba? Right! Napoleon Bonaparte.u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eFollowing the French Revolution, Napoleon was elected First Consul of France. The French citizens loved him, but there were many members of the French nobility with ties to the former kings of France who hated Napoleon\'s guts and who wanted him out. Many of these royalists plotted to kill Napoleon in various ways, to reestablish the monarchy. (That\'s were the clinch between the Royalists and Bonapartists comes in.) In April of 1814, Napoleon was officially exiled to the island of Elba off the coast of Italy. However, a year later, he escaped Elba and fled to France. He returned to Paris and ruled the French for one hundred days. He was still very popular among the French. But Napoleon\'s smallish army was defeated again by European powers, and Napoleon was exiled to the island of Saint Helena, far, far away in the Atlantic Ocean.u003cblockquoteu003en  u003cbu003eThe difference between treason and patriotism is only a matter of dates.u003c/bu003enu003c/blockquoteu003eu003ciu003eThe Count of Monte Cristou003c/iu003e begins right before Napoleon\'s first exile to Elba, and throughout the novel, we hear about Napoleon\'s armies, his escape to Paris, and about the royalist parties. Villefort, for example, is a royalist, but his father (Noirtier) fights for Napoleon. The country is in political turmoil, and corruption is everywhere (recall how Dantu00e8s ends up in jail in the first place). Following Napoleon\'s second downfall, France was ruled by a series of monarchs. The novel ends around the time when Louis-Philippe I ascends the throne and when things are starting to calm down in France.u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eI found it incredibly interesting to learn about French history in such a fun way. On top of that, having been fortunate enough, to have roamed the streets of Paris and Rome myself, I really have to say that Dumas did an amazing job at encapsulating the atmosphere of those places. I\'m aware, that 200 years ago both cities were very different from what they are now, but I cannot help but feel that Dumas really managed to depict their spirit. I felt like being there myself, breathing the same air as our characters. Additionally, Dumas never failed to include actual places (like hotels or streets) and even real people (like Countess G, who was Byron\'s mistress) in his narrative to make it seem more authentic.u003cblockquoteu003en  u003cbu003eu201cFool that I am," said he,"that I did not tear out my heart the day I resolved to revenge myself".u201du003c/bu003enu003c/blockquoteu003eFunnily enough, u003ciu003eThe Countu003c/iu003e could\'ve done with a little more romance. Yeah, shocker, I know. I thought that the Count\'s failed relationship to Mercu00e9du00e8s would play a bigger role, although, in the end, I really appreciated that they didn\'t end up together, because it was much more realistic. Nonetheless, the romantic subplot that we did indeed get, concerning Valentine and Morrel, really did deliver. Dumas went full Romeo and Juliet on us. He basically rewrites that play. :D u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eAccording to Valentine\'s dad, Morrel is not rich enough to be considered a worthy suitor for her. The two must meet secretly in the garden (OK, no balcony scene, but still u2013 a secret garden!), for Valentine has been promised to another, more eligible bachelor. The two promise to marry anyway, and with Valentine\'s grandfather\'s help and the Count\'s help, they do. The Count\'s plan involves secret and super hardcore sleeping pills that Valentine takes. Morrel and the rest of the world thinks that Valentine has died as a result of being poisoned, but really, she\'s just asleep. The Count convinces Morrel to wait for one month before committing suicide (which Morrel really wants to do, because life isn\'t worth living without his Valentine, duh). When that month is over, the Count gives Morrel a pill he promises will kill him. But the pill merely puts Morrel to sleep, and when he wakes up, Valentine is there to kiss him on the lips.u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eSo yeah, they do get their happy ending, which makes this the somewhat happy version of Shakespeare\'s play, but I honestly couldn\'t make that shit up. As much as I enjoyed the silliness of their relationship, I have to say, that the cheesy and overall too happy ending of u003ciu003eThe Countu003c/iu003e kind of killed the mood for me. This is also the main reason why I rated this book 4 stars instead of 5. I wanted more blood and more revenge at the end. Instead, the Count kind of grew soft and spared his biggest enemy to focus on the reunion of these two love birds above. CAN\'T RELATE!u003cblockquoteu003en  u003cbu003eI want to be Providence, because the things that I know which is finest, greatest and most sublime in the world is to reward and to punish.u003c/bu003enu003c/blockquoteu003eAlthough, I appreciate that Dantu00e8s finally realised that he cannot play God without severe consequences. Since, by the end of his hardships, Edmond has grown a serious God complex. He\'s built himself up so high that he can\'t help but picture himself in the most grandiose terms. Our naive poor boy, for whom we have rooted for from the start, has become quite unlikeable in his quest to seek revenge on his tormentors, not least of all because he has so few visible flaws that would make him appear more human. I always appreciated the moments in which Dantu00e8s came through again and the Count displayed some serious emotions. u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eHowever, where the Count sometimes may have seen a little devoid of emotion, the other characters of this tale really made up for it. I think my favorite ones were definitely the whole Danglars family. They were all such a mess. First and foremost, Mlle Eugu00e9nie is a gay icon and you cannot convince me otherwise. Dumas made so many allusion to her being lesbian, she is basically the Sappho of this tale. Amongst my favorite moments of her were definitely her elopement with Mlle d\'Armilly, her cross-dressing and her complete and utter disinterest in marrying the men her father propositioned to her. Eugu00e9nie was so headstrong and independent (she basically said that she just wants to be free in heart, body and soul, LIKE YAS BITCH), which was such a breath of fresh air compared to the other female characters who were either quite pure and angel-like (eg. Valentine) or very hysterical. u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eAnd even though they were little shitheads, I absolutely adored the relationship of Eugu00e9nie\'s parents u2013 the Baron Danglars and his wife Hermione. The two of them basically hated each other\'s guts and the only reason why they stayed together is for prestige and to not offend the public\'s opinion. They are both super rich (and pretty much into gambling). :D Danglars knows that his wife is cheating on him and he truly doesn\'t care but as soon as he realised that Hermione was trying to get to his money for her lover, he fucking snapped, and served me the most scalding hot tea I ever saw: "I let you. You see, it doesnu2019t matter to me, as long as you are paying for your lessons out of your own pocket. But I now see that you are dipping into mine and that your further education might cost me as mich as seven hundred thousand franc a month. Woah, Madame! It canu2019t go on like this. Either the diplomat will have to start giving his u2026 lessons for nothing, and I shall put up with him, or he will not be allowed to set foot again in my house. Do you understand?" LIKE OMG, if words could kill, Hermione would be six feet under by now.u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eOn top of that, I liked how cleverly Dumas spun this web of characters. Everyone was somehow connected to one another, which made the stakes even more higher and made his various reveals and plot twists even more exciting. u003cblockquoteu003en  u003cbu003eWhen you compare the sorrows of real life to the pleasures of the imaginary one, you will never want to live again, only to dream forever.u003c/bu003enu003c/blockquoteu003eAs for our author, Dumas\' dad was a soldier in Napoleon\'s army, but he fell out of favor there when new racist laws were established barring men of color from serving, and the family became very poor. Dumasu2019 paternal grandparents were a French soldier who was stationed in Haiti and a former slave. Dumas\' dad died when he was three, and his mother struggled to make ends meet. She didn\'t have enough money to give Dumas a really good education, but Dumas learned to read and then read as much as he possibly could. Despite their poverty, Dumas\' family still had connections to French nobility, and so, when Dumas was twenty years old, he moved to the big city of Paris and started working for the Duc d\'Orleans at the Palais Royal. (The Duc d\'Orleans was kind of a big darn deal, since he, in 1830, tok the throne, becoming King Louis-Philippe I. ;))u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eJust like his Victorian pendant Charles Dickens, Dumas became one of the first French writers who could actually be considered a celebrity of his time. He made a shitton of cash, which he spend so lavishly (by even ordering the construction of his own Chu00e2teau de Monte Cristo), that he was actually in debt very often, which he tried to avoid paying by going abroad. #MOOD! His life was as tumultuous as the plot of his novels. I can definitely see myself reading more from him.","rating":5,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/45198798?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"black-writers","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/45198798?shelf=black-writers"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2733977213"},"likeCount":201,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":0},"User:11166121":{"id":11166121,"__typename":"User","legacyId":11166121,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1522743986i/11166121._UX200_CR0,28,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":907,"viewerRelationshipStatus":null,"name":"Em Lost In Books","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11166121-em-lost-in-books","contributor":null,"followersCount":1818},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.xxBKzeGu5MPnkp_tw_lEwA":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.xxBKzeGu5MPnkp_tw_lEwA","__typename":"Review","creator":{"__ref":"User:11166121"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1695520047369,"createdAt":1526957859348,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1527419648510,"text":"I generally don\'t read classics. it\'s only in last 2-3 years that i have started collecting these lovely penguin classics editions and i emphasis here on "collecting" as it is easier than reading.

La trama presenta nel suo complesso incoerenze cronologiche, probabilmente imputabili al ritmo di composizione frettoloso e incalzante che u00e8 caratteristico del romanziere francese.u003cbru003eu003cbru003eu003cimg src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1677129332i/33970445._SX540_.jpg" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"u003eu003cbru003eu003cbu003eGu00e9rard Depardieu u00e8 Dantu00e8s nella miniserie francese, coprodotta dalla RAI, diretta dalla regista Josu00e9e Dayan. Le u201cstaru201d di casa nostra sono Ornella Muti (insieme alla figlia Naike) e Sergio Rubini.u003c/bu003eu003cbru003eu003cbru003eE ora alzo il sipario sulla parte costruens e torno a Eco: u003cbru003eDetto questo bisogna tornare allu2019affermazione du2019inizio. Montecristo u00e8 uno dei romanzi piu00f9 appassionanti che mai siano stati scritti. In un colpo solo (o in una raffica di colpi, in un cannoneggiamento a lunga gittata) partendo dalla storia sciapa di Peuchet riesce a inscatolare nello stesso romanzo tre situazioni archetipe capaci di torcere le viscere anche a un boia.u003cbru003eAnzitutto, lu2019innocenza tradita. u003cbru003eIn secondo luogo lu2019acquisizione, per colpo di fortuna, da parte della vittima perseguitata, di una fortuna immensa che lo pone al di sopra dei comuni mortali. Infine la strategia di una vendetta in cui periscono personaggi che il romanzo si u00e8 disperatamente ingegnato a rendere odiosi oltre ogni limite del ragionevole.u003cbru003eMa non basta. Su questa ossatura si dipana la rappresentazione della societu00e0 francese dei cento giorni e poi della monarchia di Luigi Filippo, coi suoi dandie, i suoi banchieri, i suoi magistrati corrotti, le sue adultere, i suoi contratti di matrimonio, le sue sedute parlamentari, i rapporti internazionali, i complotti di Stato, il telegrafo ottico, le lettere di credito, i calcoli avari e spudorati di interessi composti e dividendi, i tassi di sconto, le valute e i cambi, i pranzi, i balli, i funerali.u003cbru003eE su tutto troneggia il topos principe del feuilleton, il Superuomo. Ma diversamente che in Sue (I misteri di Parigi) e in tutti gli altri artigiani che han tentato questo luogo classico del romanzo popolare, Dumas del superuomo tenta una sconnessa e ansimante psicologia, mostrandocelo diviso tra la vertigine dellu2019onnipotenza (dovuta al denaro e al sapere) e il terrore del proprio ruolo privilegiato, in una parola, tormentato dal dubbio e rasserenato dalla coscienza che la sua onnipotenza nasce dalla sofferenza. Per cui, nuovo archetipo che si innerva sugli altri, il conte di Montecristo (potenza dei nomi) u00e8 anche un Cristo, dovutamente diabolico, che cala nella tomba del castello du2019If, vittima sacrificale dellu2019umana malvagitu00e0, e ne risale a giudicare i vivi e i morti, nel fulgore del tesoro riscoperto dopo secoli, senza mai dimenticare di essere figlio dellu2019uomo. Si puu00f2 essere blasu00e9, criticamente avveduti, saper molto di trappole intertestuali, ma si u00e8 presi nel gioco, come nel melodramma verdiano. Mu00e9lo e Kitsch, per virtu00f9 di sregolatezza, rasentano il sublime, mentre la sregolatezza si ribalta in genio.u003cbru003eRidondanza, certo, a ogni passo. Ma potremmo gustare le rivelazioni, le agnizioni a catena attraverso le quali Edmond Dantu00e8s si svela ai suoi nemici (e noi si freme, ogni volta, anche se sappiamo giu00e0 tutto) se non intervenisse, e proprio come artificio letterario, la ridondanza?u003cbru003eu003cbru003eu003cimg src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1677129332i/33970446._SX540_.jpg" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"u003eu003cbru003eu003cbu003eLo Chateau du2019If.u003c/bu003eu003cbru003eu003cbru003eEd ecco che a questo punto sorgono dubbi preoccupanti. Se Dumas fosse stato pagato non a righe in piu00f9 ma a righe in meno, e avesse accorciato, Montecristo sarebbe ancora quella macchina romanzesca che u00e8? Se fosse riassunto, se la condanna, la fuga, la scoperta del tesoro, la riapparizione a Parigi, la vendetta, anzi le vendette a catena, avvenissero tutte nel giro di due o trecento pagine, lu2019opera avrebbe ancora il suo effetto, riuscirebbe a trascinarci anche lu00e0 dove, nellu2019ansia, si saltano le pagine e le descrizioni (si saltano, ma si sa che ci sono, si accelera soggettivamente ma sapendo che il tempo narrativo u00e8 oggettivamente dilatato)? Si scopre cosu00ec che le orribili intemperanze stilistiche sono, su00ec, u201czeppeu201d ma le zeppe hanno un valore strutturale, come le sbarre di grafite nei reattori nucleari, rallentano il ritmo per rendere le nostre attese piu00f9 lancinanti, le nostre previsioni piu00f9 azzardate, il romanzo dumasiano u00e8 una macchina per produrre agonia, e non conta la qualitu00e0 dei rantoli, conta il loro tempo lungo.u003cbru003eu00c8 una questione di stile, salvo che lo stile narrativo non ha nulla a che vedere con lo stile poetico, o epistolare. u201cIl grande Meaulnesu201d di Alain Fournier u00e8 indubbiamente scritto molto meglio del Montecristo, ma alimenta la fantasia e la sensibilitu00e0 di pochi, non u00e8 immenso come Montecristo, non cosu00ec omerico, non u00e8 destinato a nutrire con pari vigore e durata lu2019immaginario collettivo. u00c8 solo unu2019opera du2019arte. Il Montecristo invece ci dice che, se narrare u00e8 unu2019arte, le regole di questu2019arte sono diverse da quelle di altri generi letterari. E che forse si puu00f2 narrare, e far grande narrativa, senza fare necessariamente quello che la sensibilitu00e0 moderna chiama opera du2019arte.u003cbru003eCi sono epopee sbilenche, che non pongono capo a unu2019opera perfetta ma a un fiume lutulento. Puu00f2 darsi che non soddisfino le regole dellu2019estetica, ma soddisfano la funzione fabulatrice, che forse non u00e8 cosu00ec direttamente connessa alla funzione estetica. Sconnesse come una serie di miti Bororo, forse riscrivibili come il ciclo Bretone u2013 e per questo poco importa se nel Montecristo conti piu00f9 la mano di Dumas o quella di Maquet.u003cbru003e(Per la cronaca Maquet era la seconda mano, quella che aiutava Dumas come se fosse un ghost-writer).u003cbru003eu003cbru003eu003cimg src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1556389100i/27422993._SX540_.jpg" class="gr-hostedUserImg" loading="lazy"u003eu003cbru003eu003cbu003eLa vera isola di Montecristo nellu2019arcipelago toscano.u003c/bu003e","rating":4,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/10490224?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"avventura","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/10490224?shelf=avventura"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"francia","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/10490224?shelf=francia"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5367118861"},"likeCount":189,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":0},"User:18922532":{"id":18922532,"__typename":"User","legacyId":18922532,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1464943334i/18922532._UX200_CR0,0,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":267,"viewerRelationshipStatus":null,"name":"Ilenia Zodiaco","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18922532-ilenia-zodiaco","contributor":null,"followersCount":14060},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.z6_7ozmLcOoeDWAZLjqhLQ":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.z6_7ozmLcOoeDWAZLjqhLQ","__typename":"Review","creator":{"__ref":"User:18922532"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1695135994190,"createdAt":1646318960085,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1646319037808,"text":"Ho solo da dire due o tre cose su questo libro e l\'ho fatto qui (c\'u00e8 anche in versione podcast)--u0026gt; u003cbr /u003eu003ca target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XMC5w1A_WEu0026amp;t=180s"u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XMC5...u003c/au003eu003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eu00e8 stato bello leggere insieme questo librone.

I\'ve read an abridged version years ago, in my teens, and although I somewhat remembered the story, I cannot recollect how I truly felt about the book. So, a reading of the complete version was due. However, last year, I had a serious falling out with Dumas over u003ciu003eThe Man in the Iron Masku003c/iu003e and vowed never to read him again. :) But here I\'m, having broken my vow a year later, ready to sing his praises. :) u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eI\'m very much pleased with my decision to read this complete version, for, in this book, I found another favourite classic and a character who is equally dear. There is no secret who that dear character is. Anyone who loved the book knows that it is none other than Edmond Dante/Count of Monte Cristo. I never envisioned Dumas as a creator of loving characters. He is more concerned with the adventurous story he writes than paying attention to the liking/disliking of his characters. And for my part, except Cornelius van Baerle and Rosa Gryphus in u003ciu003eThe Black Tulipu003c/iu003e, I cannot recall anyone I liked, or even respected until I came across Edmond Dante. Throughout the story, I felt his pain and suffering. His severe mental and physical agonies truly tormented me. Not for one minute of the reading that I felt Edmond Dante is a fictitious character, for he was made full of flesh and blood by Dumas\'s clever hands. So, it is no wonder that I felt such a connection with him. I supported his cause through and through, and though he did go a bit too far with his vengeance, I could still pardon him, for I understood the fire that burned within him - a fire to be even with those who destroyed his innocent life. u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eThe story of u003ciu003eThe Count of Monte Cristou003c/iu003e is that of justice and retribution. And even though Edmond Dante wrongfully believes him to be the hand of the God that brings destruction on his persecutors, Dumas, through his sensitive and intelligent writing, implies many justifications for his right to vengeance. The characters were crafted so well, especially those of the villains, that I felt pleasure at being a secret party to the Count\'s plots to secure their downfall. It sounds mean, I know, and I attribute the fault to Dumas\'s fine writing. :)u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eThematically, the idea of justice and retribution goes beyond that of human justice and retribution. When Count of Monte Cristo says that u003ciu003e "all human wisdom is contained in these two words - Wait and Hope"u003c/iu003e, he knows that he has stretched too far in his vengeance and that God alone has the wisdom in deciding rightful justice and retribution. He understands the errors of human justice since some of his actions against the wicked, too, were in error.u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eSince I mentioned Dumas\'s writing, I must say that it is the key to the book\'s success. It is simply beautiful, passionate, sincere, and heartfelt. I met that passionate and heartfelt writer first in u003ciu003eThe Black Tulipu003c/iu003e. Then, I lost him down the way. But, in u003ciu003eThe Count of Monte Cristou003c/iu003e I meet him again and am truly happy about that.u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eu003ciu003eThe Count of Monte Cristou003c/iu003e is both plot and character driven, and I enjoyed that very much. It is not perfect. There were many implausible incidents I overlooked and boring and tedious sections I plodded on. But, whatever flaws it presented, the book commanded an overall sense of completion, which left me with a sense of utmost satisfaction. I feel I\'m well rewarded for my time and labour, and for that, Dumas has my gratitude. And after my somewhat stormy literary relationship with him, I\'m parting from him, this time, with a peaceful and content heart. :)","rating":5,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/48056505?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"french-lit","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/48056505?shelf=french-lit"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"favorite-classic","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/48056505?shelf=favorite-classic"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"my-library","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/48056505?shelf=my-library"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3784786535"},"likeCount":166,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":0},"User:50043037":{"id":50043037,"__typename":"User","legacyId":50043037,"imageUrlSquare":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/users/1609710206i/50043037._UX200_CR0,0,200,200_.jpg","isAuthor":false,"textReviewsCount":173,"viewerRelationshipStatus":null,"name":"Talkincloud","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50043037-talkincloud","contributor":null,"followersCount":3368},"Review:kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.l0cfmc7AtDcOBe5EYspkpA":{"id":"kca://review:goodreads/amzn1.gr.review:goodreads.v1.l0cfmc7AtDcOBe5EYspkpA","__typename":"Review","creator":{"__ref":"User:50043037"},"recommendFor":null,"updatedAt":1695838551017,"createdAt":1677003534176,"spoilerStatus":false,"lastRevisionAt":1677003563513,"text":"Jedna z najlepszych ksiu0105u017cek, jakie przeczytau0142em w u017cyciu.

Most of you know the story, itu2019s been reviewed a million times. u003cbru003eu003cbru003eI expunged a good dose of stale air from my lungs when I completed this colossus. These guttural expulsions were due to a combination of sadness, amazement, and approbation for this most wonderful of works.

Everything about it feels long--from the words, to the sentences, to the scenes. Given that it was serially published -- meaning Dumas made his money by the word -- it\'s obvious why it\'s so damn long. But trust me, u003cbu003ethis story is NOT a waste of time.u003c/bu003eu003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eWhat it is--is everything. What starts as a thriller, becomes a Game of Thrones-style soap opera, and finishes as a murder mystery. It\'s a revenge story, in theory, but more than anything it\'s about love. It\'s really an existential coming-of-age for adults. The length of seven books, u003ciu003eThe Count of Monte Cristou003c/iu003e contains nearly as many themes and plots and characters. Probably, it covers twice as many subjects. It\'s basically a Bible.u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eSomething tricky about it is that the first hundred and some pages are absolutely phenomenal. The story starts better than just about anything else, which kind of surprised me. For something of this length, I expected it to be slow--and at times it is--but the beginning is definitely a page turner, one that doesn\'t read dated at all, which again surprised me. This book is like two hundred years old and translated from French--and while at times it\'s as head-scratching as Shakespeare--the beginning feels like reading a really good Michael Crichton book.u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eEdmond Dantes / The Count of Monte Cristo is, logically, the first character introduced. He\'s incredibly likable from the start: he\'s 19, has his shit together, treats his father like gold, is madly in love, and excellent at his job. In short, there\'s a Disney story ahead of him. Just thinking about it is exciting, until in quick succession several extremely unlikable characters are introduced whom all conspire against him. They\'re jealous little evil bitches and they plot and scheme, and as their deeds unfold, the story becomes a thriller. Unfortunately, the characters that start the book are definitely the best, beside one or two others. Fortunately, after they throw a giant fork into Dantes\' road, they don\'t just disappear. No, this is a revenge story. They come back and get what they got coming to \'em.u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eThe problems start to arise after the first 300 or so pages, after Dantes gets screwed, suffers, loses hope, becomes bitter, and transcends into the Count of Monte Cristo. After this, about 15 new characters are introduced, only one of whom really measures up to the previous cast. Dumas spends the next 500 pages of the story predominately fleshing out these characters in the form of a soap opera, which is frustrating. The previous ones are so good, you\'re way more eager to learn about them. It feels like you\'re getting off topic, lost in new characters that only fit into the story tangentially by theme. And, although this part isn\'t necessarily bad or insufferable, compared to the thrilling first act, this soap opera seems that way. It doesn\'t help that this part of the story is when the language dates itself, the sentences grow to their longest, the dialogue seems like one soliloquy after another, and the words they speak are plain archaic. The story seems to go downhill, quickly picking up steam, ultimately headed for a nasty crash and burn.u003cbr /u003eu003cbr /u003eIt doesn\'t. If the first hundred pages aren\'t the best in all of literature, it\'s only because the last hundred are somehow even better. All of the crazy complexity Dumas writes into the second act of the story comes together in the third. What seemed to only tangentially fit into the story becomes the glue that holds together a masterpiece. And when The Count of Monte Cristo starts exacting his revenge you spent 900 pages eagerly anticipating, of course it\'s satisfying as hell. What makes it even better is seeing Edmond Dantes resurface himself in the ugly skin of Monte Cristo. After all his misery has made his existence merely to put others through worse (albeit somewhat justifiably), you start to love him again, and he shows that u003ciu003eThe Count of Monte Cristou003c/iu003e isn\'t a simple revenge story that went on for way too long.

The poisoner, the former revolutionary, turned mute, and the traitor, and the cursed son, Benedetto, with an incredible fate. My great-grandfather loved this story, a just man who loses everything before taking revenge on his enemies who had become rich and powerful in the Paris of the Restoration. Dumas\' storytelling art unfolds in his stories throughout history: Roman bandits, oriental adventures, and the crime of Caderousse told by a witness hidden in his inn on a stormy night. Above all these characters, the Providence\'s agent, the count and his doubles, the Italian abbot, and the English lord make this classic an absolute pleasure to read!","rating":5,"shelving":{"__typename":"Shelving","shelf":{"__typename":"Shelf","name":"read","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/117399210?shelf=read"},"taggings":[{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"e-5","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/117399210?shelf=e-5"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"historical-fiction","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/117399210?shelf=historical-fiction"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"adventure","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/117399210?shelf=adventure"}},{"__typename":"Tagging","tag":{"__typename":"Tag","name":"french-literature","webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/117399210?shelf=french-literature"}}],"webUrl":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3408565395"},"likeCount":141,"viewerHasLiked":null,"commentCount":0}},"authContextParams":{"signedIn":false,"customerId":null,"legacyCustomerId":null,"role":"user"},"userAgentContextParams":{"isWebView":null},"userAgent":"python-requests/2.28.2"},"__N_SSP":true},"page":"/book/show/[book_id]","query":{"book_id":"7126.The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo"},"buildId":"w89JVdfPa9eIbUNW1kyic","runtimeConfig":{"env":"Production"},"isFallback":false,"gssp":true,"customServer":true,"locales":["en","ab","aa","af","ak","sq","am","ar","an","hy","as","av","ae","ay","az","bm","ba","eu","be","bn","bh","bi","bs","br","bg","my","ca","ch","ce","ceb","ny","zh","zh-TW","cv","kw","co","cr","hr","cs","da","dv","nl","eo","et","ee","fo","fj","fi","fr","ff","gl","ka","de","el","gn","gu","ht","ha","he","hz","hi","ho","hu","ia","id","ie","ilo","ga","ig","ik","io","is","it","iu","ja","jv","kl","kn","kr","ks","kk","km","ki","rw","ky","kv","kg","ko","ku","kj","la","lb","lg","li","ln","lo","lt","lu","lv","gv","mk","mg","ms","ml","mt","mi","mr","mh","mn","na","nv","nb","nd","ne","new","ng","nn","no","ii","nr","oc","oj","cu","om","or","os","pa","pi","fa","pl","ps","pt","qu","rm","rn","ro","ru","sa","sc","sd","se","sm","sg","sr","gd","sn","si","sk","sl","so","st","es","su","sw","ss","sv","ta","te","tg","th","ti","bo","tk","tl","tn","to","tr","ts","tt","tw","ty","ug","uk","ur","uz","ve","vi","vo","wa","cy","wo","fy","xh","yi","yo","za"]}"'
