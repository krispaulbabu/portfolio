          Hello there! Thanks for stopping by my portfolio. I&apos;m a 21-year-old
          software developer originally from the UAE, and I recently completed
          my Bachelor of Science degree with a specialization in Computing at
          Macquarie University. <br/><br/>
          
          During my academic journey and beyond, I&apos;ve
          delved into the worlds of software development, data science, machine
          learning, and statistical computing. I&apos;m passionate about creating
          efficient software solutions and using data to make informed
          decisions. <br/><br/>
          
          In this portfolio, you&apos;ll find a collection of my projects,
          each representing a unique aspect of my journey. I&apos;m dedicated to
          pushing the boundaries of technology and exploring new possibilities.<br/><br/>

          potential collaborations, I&apos;m here to connect. Please feel free to
